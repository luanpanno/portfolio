## 👋 About

Firstly my portfolio was made with just HTML and CSS, then I changed it to React, and now it's using Nextjs... really cool, tho! In this version (can I call it v4.0.0?) I just simplified the website styles, and added the internacionalization (by now, just two languages: portuguese and english).
